What is the code-to-data paradigm?	Push processing to the database instead of fetching all data to application server
What is wrong with SELECT * FROM table INTO TABLE itab followed by LOOP with calculations?	Data-to-code approach - inefficient. Should use aggregations in SELECT.
How do you calculate SUM in database instead of ABAP loop?	SELECT SUM( netwr ) FROM vbak INTO @DATA(lv_total).
Why should you avoid SELECT in loops?	Each iteration causes database roundtrip - very poor performance
What is the FOR ALL ENTRIES syntax?	SELECT * FROM kna1 FOR ALL ENTRIES IN @lt_customers WHERE kunnr = @lt_customers-kunnr INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_kna1).
What should you check before using FOR ALL ENTRIES?	Check if the driver table is not empty (IF lt_driver IS NOT INITIAL)
What does AMDP stand for?	ABAP Managed Database Procedure
What interface must AMDP class implement?	if_amdp_marker_hdb
How do you declare an AMDP method?	METHOD get_data BY DATABASE PROCEDURE FOR HDB LANGUAGE SQLSCRIPT OPTIONS READ-ONLY USING table1 table2.
What language is used inside AMDP methods?	SQLScript
How do you use aggregations in SELECT?	SELECT kunnr, COUNT(*) AS order_count, SUM(netwr) AS total_amount, AVG(netwr) AS avg_amount FROM vbak GROUP BY kunnr INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_summary).
How do you use CASE in SELECT statement?	SELECT vbeln, CASE vbtyp WHEN 'C' THEN 'Order' WHEN 'G' THEN 'Contract' ELSE 'Other' END AS doc_type FROM vbak INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_orders).
What is the syntax for INNER JOIN in Open SQL?	SELECT h~vbeln, k~name1 FROM vbak AS h INNER JOIN kna1 AS k ON h~kunnr = k~kunnr INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_result).
What transaction is used for runtime analysis?	SAT (or SE30 in older systems)
What transaction is used for SQL trace?	ST05
What is the HAVING clause used for?	Filter aggregated results: GROUP BY kunnr HAVING SUM(netwr) > 1000
How do you limit result rows in SELECT?	UP TO 100 ROWS
How do you use ORDER BY in SELECT?	SELECT ... FROM ... ORDER BY field1 DESCENDING, field2 INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_result).
What is the benefit of using CDS views over multiple SELECTs?	Associations are resolved efficiently in database, single query instead of multiple
How do you create intermediate tables in AMDP?	lt_temp = SELECT ... FROM table; Then use :lt_temp in subsequent queries
What OPTIONS can be set for AMDP?	READ-ONLY (for read operations), or omit for write operations
