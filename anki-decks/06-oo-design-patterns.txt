What is the Singleton pattern?	Ensures only one instance of a class exists throughout the application
How do you implement Singleton in ABAP?	CLASS zcl_singleton DEFINITION CREATE PRIVATE. CLASS-DATA: go_instance TYPE REF TO zcl_singleton. CLASS-METHODS: get_instance RETURNING VALUE(ro) TYPE REF TO zcl_singleton.
What is the Factory pattern?	Creates objects without specifying their exact class - uses interface return type
How do you implement Factory in ABAP?	CLASS-METHODS create_processor IMPORTING iv_type TYPE string RETURNING VALUE(ro) TYPE REF TO zif_processor. CASE iv_type. WHEN 'A'. ro = NEW zcl_type_a( ). ENDCASE.
What is the Strategy pattern?	Defines family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, makes them interchangeable
How is Strategy pattern implemented?	Interface defines algorithm. Multiple classes implement it. Context class receives strategy via constructor.
What is the Observer pattern?	Defines one-to-many dependency - when one object changes, dependents are notified
How do you implement Observer in ABAP?	Subject has mt_observers table, attach/detach methods, and notify method that loops through observers calling their update method.
What is the Decorator pattern?	Attaches additional responsibilities to object dynamically - alternative to subclassing
What is an abstract class in ABAP?	CLASS zcl_abstract DEFINITION ABSTRACT. Cannot be instantiated directly, may contain abstract methods.
How do you define an abstract method?	METHODS process ABSTRACT IMPORTING iv_data TYPE string.
How do you override a method in subclass?	METHODS process REDEFINITION.
What is a friend class?	A class that can access protected/private members of another class: FRIENDS zcl_friend_class.
How do you define an event in ABAP?	EVENTS data_processed EXPORTING VALUE(ev_count) TYPE i.
How do you raise an event?	RAISE EVENT data_processed EXPORTING ev_count = lv_count.
How do you handle an event?	METHODS on_processed FOR EVENT data_processed OF zcl_publisher IMPORTING ev_count.
How do you register an event handler?	SET HANDLER me->on_processed FOR io_publisher.
What is the Single Responsibility Principle (S in SOLID)?	A class should have only one reason to change - one responsibility
What is the Open/Closed Principle (O in SOLID)?	Open for extension, closed for modification - use inheritance/interfaces
What is the Liskov Substitution Principle (L in SOLID)?	Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
What is the Interface Segregation Principle (I in SOLID)?	Don't force classes to implement methods they don't use - split interfaces
What is the Dependency Inversion Principle (D in SOLID)?	Depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concretions (concrete classes)
How do you implement interface in ABAP?	INTERFACES zif_processor. Then implement: METHOD zif_processor~process.
What is constructor injection?	Pass dependencies via constructor: METHODS constructor IMPORTING io_repository TYPE REF TO zif_repository.
What makes code testable?	Dependency injection, small focused methods, interfaces for external dependencies
