How do you define a test class?	CLASS ltc_test DEFINITION FOR TESTING DURATION SHORT RISK LEVEL HARMLESS.
What are the DURATION options for test class?	SHORT, MEDIUM, LONG
What are the RISK LEVEL options?	HARMLESS, DANGEROUS, CRITICAL
What method runs once before all tests in the class?	class_setup (CLASS-METHODS)
What method runs once after all tests in the class?	class_teardown (CLASS-METHODS)
What method runs before each test method?	setup
What method runs after each test method?	teardown
How do you mark a method as a test?	METHOD test_something FOR TESTING.
How do you assert two values are equal?	cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_equals( act = lv_actual exp = lv_expected msg = 'Values should be equal' ).
How do you assert two values are different?	cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_differs( act = lv_actual exp = lv_not_expected msg = 'Values should differ' ).
How do you assert a boolean is true?	cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_true( act = lv_boolean msg = 'Should be true' ).
How do you assert a boolean is false?	cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_false( act = lv_boolean msg = 'Should be false' ).
How do you assert a value is initial?	cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_initial( act = lv_value msg = 'Should be initial' ).
How do you assert a value is not initial?	cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_not_initial( act = lv_value msg = 'Should not be initial' ).
How do you assert an object reference is bound?	cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_bound( act = lo_object msg = 'Should be bound' ).
How do you fail a test explicitly?	cl_abap_unit_assert=>fail( msg = 'Test should not reach here' ).
What is the Given-When-Then pattern?	Given: Setup test data. When: Execute code under test. Then: Assert expected results.
How do you create a test double (mock)?	mo_mock = CAST #( cl_abap_testdouble=>create( 'ZIF_INTERFACE' ) ).
How do you configure mock behavior?	cl_abap_testdouble=>configure_call( mo_mock )->returning( value ). mo_mock->method( ).
How do you verify mock was called?	cl_abap_testdouble=>verify_expectations( mo_mock ).
How do you test that an exception is raised?	TRY. method_call( ). cl_abap_unit_assert=>fail( 'Exception expected' ). CATCH zcx_expected. ENDTRY.
How do you create CDS test environment?	environment = cl_cds_test_environment=>create( i_for_entity = 'ZI_ENTITY' ).
How do you insert test data for CDS tests?	environment->insert_test_data( lt_test_data ).
How do you clear test doubles between tests?	environment->clear_doubles( ).
How do you destroy test environment?	environment->destroy( ).
How do you rollback entity changes in tests?	ROLLBACK ENTITIES.
What is a stub vs a mock?	Stub: Returns predefined values. Mock: Also verifies interactions/calls.
How do you measure runtime in a test?	GET RUN TIME FIELD lv_start. ... GET RUN TIME FIELD lv_end. lv_runtime = lv_end - lv_start.
What is dependency injection?	Pass dependencies (like repositories) via constructor to allow mocking in tests
